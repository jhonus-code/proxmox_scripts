How to use?

In the shell of the proxmox node use this command and start shortening your installation times.

bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magoblanco66/proxmox_scripts/main/menuinstaller.sh)"


If you want to automate any installation you need with the different scripts you can always add and complete it.
